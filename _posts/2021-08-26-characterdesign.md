**Base price : 100$**
  *Front view of the character I designed for you in a dynamic or neutral pose. Slightly rendered, no background.*


#### How to order

Use the contact form and include the following :

- Commission type

- Character name, description (personnality etc) & reference

- things you want to appear in the commission (expression, background, pose,...)


   Once I receive and approve your order, I will do a sketch and revise it until you are happy with it. Then we'll proceed with the 50% of the payment and I will start working on your piece. If you're happy with it, I'll send you the full res file upon reception of the remaining amount. You can email me to get WIP anytime. (I'll send WIP for the sketch, rough colour and finished render anyway)

- Sketching will take up to 3 days

- Each piece should take something like 1 or 2 weeks (depending on the complexity of the piece and type of commission)
